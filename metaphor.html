                <p>Often uses “is” or
                    “are” to compare one
                    object or idea to
                    another. Makes a
                    direct comparison</p>

                        <p>I thought it rather strange today,
                            When visiting the zoo,
                            To find the creatures living there,
                            Are just like me and you.
                            So wild and acrobatic,
                            The monkeys in their cage,
                            Delight in swinging high and low,
                            Performers on a stage.
                            Dignified and tall, the penguins on the ice,
                            Waiters in their black and white,
                            Proper and precise.
                            Gazelles turn together,
                            A troupe of graceful, dancing girls,
                            Synchronized and slender,
                            Performing plies, jumps, and twirls.
                            Poor zebras are the prisoners,
                            Condemned for life, you know,
                            Their classic uniform of stripes,
                            Truly marks them so.
                            If I had all day, I'd surely make,
                            Some other metaphors,
                            For sloths, and tigers, elephants,
                            And even dinosaurs.</p>

                    <div id="pp2" style="display: none;">
                        <p>The shining peaks of white,
                            The mountains soaring tall,
                            Traversed with scarlet rivers,
                            Multicolored waterfall.
                            Upon the mountains high,
                            Bright and vibrant shoots,
                            Are scattered like the trace,
                            Of tiny fairy fruits.
                            But what is this I see?
                            The mountains are receding,
                            The sugar river flowing swift,
                            Is quickly disappearing.
                            And now there's nothing left,
                            Of the mountains and the stream,
                            Except a trace of pinkish snow,
                            That smells like... ice cream.</p>

                    <div id="pp3" style="display: none;">
                        <p>A piece of popcorn escaped from the pan and flew across the kitchen like Superman.

                            It ping-ponged back and forth between the oven and the freezer. Then it shot up to the
                            ceiling like a daredevil trapeezer.

                            I tried and tried to catch it, but it never missed a trick. So finally I gave up and ate a
                            liquorice stick.</p>
