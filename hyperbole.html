                            kitchen can get frantic Our soup is deeper than the sea Our noodles stretch a mile The bread
                            is longer than a train It's sure to make you smile We pile our peas up mountain high One
                            cookie hides the moon We pour our iced tea into boats We hope you'll visit soon</p>

                            Alone in a room.
                            My mom put me in timeout.
                            So lonely, it's been 10,000 years,
                            So lonely no one remembers me at all,
                            So lonely my whole world is just this
                            room.
                            Oh wait!
                            My 5 minutes are up.

                        <p>In a house the size of a postage stamp lived a man as big as a barge. His mouth could drink
                            the entire river You could say it was rather large For dinner he would eat a trillion beans
                            And a silo full of grain, Washed it down with a tanker of milk As if he were a drain.</p>
